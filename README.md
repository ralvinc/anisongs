# AniSongs

Simply adding an anime theme to my youtube playlist involves a lot oh steps. I first need to open an anime database website (e.g. MyAnimeList), search for the anime in their database, find the section which displays the different themes, select the theme I need, copy the title of the theme, paste it on youtube's search bar, and select a video before I am able to add it to my playlist. 

This is a website that simplifies that process. Instead of manually doing everything, I can search for the anime on **AniSongs**, select and click on the anime theme that I need, and it will automatically redirect me to a Youtube page already displaying the search results for that theme. From there, I can simply choose a video and add it to my playlist.
