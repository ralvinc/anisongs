# AniSongs

Simply adding an anime theme to my youtube playlist forces me to first open an anime database website (e.g. MyAnimeList), search for the anime in their database, find the section which displays the different themes, select the theme I need, copy the title of the theme, paste it on youtube's search bar, and select a video before I am able to add it to my playlist. 

This is a website that simplifies that process. Instead of manually doing everything, I can search for the anime on AniSongs, select the anime theme I need, and click on it to redirect me to a Youtube page displaying the search results for that theme. From there, I can simply choose a video and add it to my playlist.
